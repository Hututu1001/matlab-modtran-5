MODTRAN is a FORTRAN code for solving the radiative transfer problem in the Earth's atmosphere. This Matlab class wrapper encapsulates a run of a MODTRAN 5 case. It provides methods for reading and writing MODTRAN case (tape5) files, creating and modifying case files, calling MODTRAN and reading the MODTRAN results. There are also a number of methods for plotting MODTRAN outputs. The wrapper does not (as yet) provide a GUI and MODTRAN itself is not included.

In order to use the wrapper you will need a MODTRAN 5 distribution, which can be purchased from Ontar Corporation. You will also need a Matlab installation that supports the new Matlab class files. The new class file was introduced around the 2010a release
